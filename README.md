## Project Description and Requirements# CSCE5210 Project #1

This project was undertaken as part of the Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence course in the Computer Science MS program at The University of North Texas. 

The purpose of the project was to gain an understanding of an agent's navigation through a stochastic environment that mimics a real-worl environment.

## Project Description:

The ABC company employs a fleet of vehicles of 30 vans to service the transportation needs of its customers. The company serves its customers in a 10-hour period between 8 am and 6 pm. No pickup requests are accepted after 6 pm. Vans will continue to run after 6 pm until all the customers are dropped off, even though no pickup requests are accepted after 6pm.  

Two types of scheduling occur, pickup and drop off. Firstly, the company assigns a van to a customer based on proximity of the vehicle to the customer‚Äôs pickup location. This assignment of van to customer is done by examining all of the van‚Äôs service queues and assigning the van whose last request is closest in terms of weighted distance to the customer‚Äôs pickup location, provided that there are no more than 5 requests in that van‚Äôs service queue. This is because a van‚Äôs capacity is 6 (a maximum of 5 customers can be in the van at any given point in time, plus the driver).  '

If all vans are full to capacity, then a message saying ‚ÄúNo vans are available, try again in 15 minutes‚Äù is displayed. Once a van is assigned to a customer, a pickup request is added to the service queue for that van. Along with the pickup request, a drop off request for each customer in the van must also be generated. 

The ordering of requests in the service queue is determined purely on the basis of minimization of weighted distance.
